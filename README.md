# Elixir Study Library
My personal Elixir programming language studies and exercises, based on [Dave Thomas' Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) book.

**Disclaimer**: Not all files in this repository were created by me, some of them were copied from the book for easier access. These files will have this information at the top.
